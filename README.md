## Engineering

We use Ganache for running a local blockchain:

1. Install truffle and ganache:

```
npm install -g truffle
```

```
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

2. Run local blockchain instance:

Modify `truffle-config.js` to enable the development stanza:

```
development: {
  host: "127.0.0.1",
  port: 8545,
  network_id: "*",
  gas: 800000000,
}
```

```
ganache-cli --defaultBalanceEther 10000 -l 80000000000000 --accounts 21 -m "pave trigger reduce glass cram famous still web glare mechanic train next"
```

We recommend using tmux or a separate terminal for running ganache so that you can monitor logging in the console while also running additional commands to interact with the chain in a separate terminal window.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests for SHARE smart contracts are implemented using Truffle. To run them:

```shell
# Install Solidity dependencies specified in package.json
npm install

# Run smart contract unit tests using truffle
truffle test
```

## Running Individual Unit Tests

```shell
truffle test -g "License denial non-approved collection build"
```

## Truffle interactive blockchain console

To interact with deployed contracts you can use the truffle console:

```shell
MNEMONIC_PHRASE=$MNEMONIC RPC_ENDPIONT_OPTIMISM=$RPC_ENDPOINT_OPTIMISM RPC_ENDPOINT_POLYGON_MAINNET=$RPC_ENDPOINT_POLYGON_MAINNET truffle console --network=optimism
```

From the console you can then call "migrate" which will execute the code in `migrations/1_initial_migration.js` and deploy the respective contracts to the selected blockchain. From the console you can instantiate a reference to the contract using:

```javascript
truffle(optimism)> let share_instance = await SHARE.at("0x02C4C02247a7bEA0A27825FBE7a11B0C1eA5e7bc");

```

```shell
truffle(optimism)> share_instance.addApprovedBuild("0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000", 0, "solc", "0.8.11+commit.d7f03943", "0x005D2246cE91890DbdeD3195a94095c560d5c363");
```

### Performing specific contract migrations using Truffle

```shell
MNEMONIC_PHRASE=$MNEMONIC RPC_ENDPOINT_POLYGON_MAINNET=$RPC_ENDPOINT_POLYGON_MAINNET GAS_VALUE=12000000 truffle console --network=polygon
```

```
migrate --f 2 --to 2
```

The command above deploys the contracts as specified in `2_SL2RD_migration.js`.
